A friend of mine recently shared a link to a space-themed hackathon, after we'd had too many vodka toasts at a Russian birthday party and I'd said that I wanted to be an astronaut. I decided to go on a whim, still hitting the snooze button six times that morning and sleeping in two hours too long. Four coffees later, I met software engineers Alex and Frank to form Team Micro. This is what we came up with for the Quantly 2018 Astropreneurship, Space Medicine and DataVerse [Hackathon](https://www.quantlyhackathon2018.org/) at Harvard University:

We designed and demoed a biofeedback device that uses LiDAR and EEG to improve localization and orientation in microgravity environments.


Our project tied for first with the only other project being demoed: Deep Space Pulsar Navigation System (DSPNS), which can be found [here](https://devpost.com/software/deep-space-pulsar-navigation-system-dspns).
